Each of the 5 models are broken out into separate R files that can be run using the csv files in this folder. Each R file has the code for both the mushroom data set and the credit card data set. The libraries should be included either as you go through the code or at the top of each R file. It should be run line by line. The training and testing datasets are created in each R file, so the csv files in this folder are the full data sets. The file paths would need to be changed depending on where you save the csv files in order to load in the data.
